# Cardtainers

A drop-in replacement for [Containerise](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/containerise/) for trading cards.

Install from [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cardtainers/).

## Differences

Generation of container rules is no longer necessary, you just need to paste in a list of your puppets into the text area under the extension toolbar button like
    
    ```
    kazakhstan
    norway
    puppet farmer 1
    ```

This helps a lot for people who found puppets often, as container rule generation can be a nuisance.
